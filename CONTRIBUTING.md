# Contributing to Embedded Swift Xcode Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to make Embedded Swift development on ESP32 as approachable as possible — contributions of all kinds are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports** — Found something broken? Open an issue.
- **Feature requests** — Have an idea? Open an issue and describe it.
- **Documentation** — Improve README, add examples, fix typos.
- **Code** — Fix bugs, add features, improve scripts.
- **Testing** — Try the installer on a different machine and report results.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Embedded-Swift-Xcode-Template.git
cd Embedded-Swift-Xcode-Template
```

### 2. Set up your environment

```bash
bash install.sh
```

### 3. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 4. Make your changes and test them

If you changed the template, a script in `scripts/` or `install.sh`, build a project from the template for every chip it offers:

```bash
bash tests/test_template.sh            # all chips
bash tests/test_template.sh esp32c6    # one chip
```

It creates each project the way Xcode does and builds it with the ESP-IDF and Swift toolchain `install.sh` installed (run `install.sh` first). Each chip takes about half a minute. GitHub Actions runs the same test for every pull request, after installing everything with `install.sh` on a fresh macOS runner.

The test doesn't cover Xcode or hardware, so for changes there, also check by hand:
- After running `install.sh` and restarting Xcode, **ESP32 RISC-V** appears under File → New → Project → Other, with the **Chip** pop-up.
- A new project's `sdkconfig.defaults` has the chip you picked, and `README.md` sits next to the `.xcodeproj`.
- `Cmd+B` builds without flashing, and `Cmd+R` flashes your board and shows its serial output.
- After that first build, code completion works in `Firmware/Firmware.swift` (e.g. typing `led_strip_` or `blinkStep`), `Cmd+U` runs the Kit package's tests, and Command-clicking `vTaskDelay` opens FreeRTOS's `task.h`.

### 5. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe what you did"
```

### 6. Push and open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then open a PR on GitHub against the `main` branch.

## Coding Guidelines

### Shell Scripts
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Add `set -e` for scripts where partial failure is unacceptable
- Comment every non-obvious section
- All comments and output in **English**
- Use `$HOME` instead of `~` in paths (more portable)
- Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon if possible

### Swift (ESPSwiftInstaller)
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- All comments in **English**
- Use `@MainActor` for UI updates
- Prefer `async/await` over callbacks where possible

### Commit Messages
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
feat: add GPIO example
fix: resolve CH340 port detection on macOS Ventura
docs: update README with serial monitor guide
chore: update .gitignore
refactor: simplify detect_port.sh

## Reporting Bugs

When opening a bug report, please include:

- macOS version
- Xcode version
- Board model and chip (e.g. ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1)
- USB interface (native USB-CDC / CH340 / CP210x)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs (build output, serial output, `/var/log/install.log`)

---

## Hardware Requirements for Testing

To fully test this project you need:
- A development board with a RISC-V based ESP32 chip, such as the ESP32-C6
- USB cable (USB-C or Micro-USB depending on board)
- macOS 12+ with Xcode 15+

If you don't have hardware, you can still contribute to:
- Documentation and README
- ESPSwiftInstaller SwiftUI app
- Shell script logic (without flash testing)

---

## Known Limitations

Before contributing, it helps to know the current limitations:

- Embedded Swift is experimental — not all Swift standard library features work
- Xcode's debug console is read-only (no serial input)
