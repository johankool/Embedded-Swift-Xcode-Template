// swift-tools-version: 6.0

// Plain Swift code, without ESP-IDF, and its tests. The firmware uses it
// (see Firmware/Package.swift), and as a package of the Xcode project its
// tests run on the Mac: press Cmd+U, or run `swift test` in this folder.
//
// Code here must work in Embedded Swift too, as it's built into the
// firmware.
